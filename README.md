# OSPRS - QuestionnaireApp

> üò∑ Solution for assessing the risk of contagious viral infections (e.g. COVID-19, Monkeypox)

> This is the preceding project of [CovApp](https://github.com/CovOpen/CovApp-2.0), which was featured on [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01797-0)

OSPRS can help users to assess their medical condition better, provide recommendations regarding doctor‚Äôs visits or coronavirus testing by answering a few questions. 

Additionally, every filled out questionnaire summarizes relevant medical information for future doctor‚Äôs consultation in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing the OSPRS - QuestionnaireApp, any medical institution can reduce the number of new incoming patients, avoid physical contact and speed up the patient registration process.
